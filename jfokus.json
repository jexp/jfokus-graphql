But we have been banging on about this since the 70s, and still we are creating big balls of mud -- now even the distributed kind. Either modularity as a concept is insufficient or maybe there are aspects here we seem to get wrong. We know that good fences make good neighbours, but only when the boundaries are placed correctly. How can we create robust and sustainable modular designs when identifying those boundaries are so challenging?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we are going to take a closer look at why modularity is needed, what it actually can do for us, and how we can increase our chances of getting it right by taking a systems thinking approach. The claim made is that a holistic view of the problem space is critical; one that consider all its parts, including the business and all the people affected. Software development today is a inherently a sociotechnical endeavour and any modularisation effort, be it information hiding, SOA, microservices, DDD, Team Topologies and more, must take this into account in order to be able to create solutions that are sustainable and have the necessary conceptual integrity. \r\n\r\nIn summary, this talk will help you piece together all of the these good modularisation practices and understand the theory behind them, improving your holistic system design skills, and enabling you to create requisite coherence in your designs.

The Web Authentication standard promises phishing-proof public-key authentication that is both stronger and easier to use than other widely used two-factor authentication (2FA), and is already widely supported by all major platforms and browsers. How does that work, and how is it different from other 2FA methods? How do you use it as a user, and how can you enable it as a developer? Can you finally get rid of passwords? In this talk we'll answer all of these questions and more, and walk through implementing WebAuthn authentication.","speakers":[13575],"startTime":1651651800,"location":"Room C1","id":894,"endTime":1651654800,"title":"User-friendly, phishing-proof 2FA with WebAuthn","type":"presentation"},{"summary":"Welcome note and introduction to Jfokus 2022","speakers":[13434],"startTime":1651561200,"location":"Room A1","id":709,"endTime":1651562100,"title":"Welcome note and introduction to Jfokus 2022","type":"keynote"},{"summary":"Over the past year, Service Mesh has emerged as a critical component of the cloud native stack. It makes communication between service instances flexible, reliable, and fast, so developers can focus on adding business value and letting the mesh does all the complex non-functional work like service discovery, load balancing, encryption, authentication, authorization, support for the circuit breaker pattern, and other capabilities.\r\n\r\nIn this session we\u2019ll provide an introduction to service mesh, starting with somehow the philosophical questions: do we really need a service mesh? what it can do and why people are interested in it ? Going it really to make all our problems disappear?\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll also explore how it simplifies application design and also where it adds complexity. All with some demos that highlight how the new microservices architectures, as well as legacy monolith applications, could benefit from service mech!","speakers":[13590],"startTime":1651586400,"location":"Room A2","id":902,"endTime":1651589400,"title":"What the hell is service mesh anyway !?","type":"presentation"},{"summary":"Imagine when more than half a million citizens are suddenly ordered home. Imagine then when more than four hundred thousand of them are temporarily laid off. Imagine then when many of them lose all their income and their businesses, while unable to do any other job. This is the story about how developers from the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration became the first responders over night as the country were closing down. The talk will share with you how it was possible to save thousands of lives through software written in Java, Kotlin and React. The talk will discuss key technologies allowing rapid product delivery, cross-functional product teams, servant leadership, communities of practice, building skills and sharing knowledge.","speakers":[13449],"startTime":1651590000,"location":"Room C3","id":727,"endTime":1651593000,"title":"When Software Saves Lives - Developers as First Responders","type":"presentation"},{"summary":"Cloud-Native is a blotted term, it means a lot of things in various contexts and is used sometimes in very un-appropriate use cases. But regardless of the situation, an application could be Cloud Native and easily portable across clouds if it follows some basic patterns. In this talk, we will explore 5 of the topic patterns an app has to follow to be called Cloud Native.","speakers":[13623],"startTime":1651647600,"location":"Room C4","id":927,"endTime":1651650600,"title":"You application is not Cloud Native","type":"presentation"}]}
